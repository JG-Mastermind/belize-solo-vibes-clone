# Admin Functionality Test Results

## Changes Made to Fix getUserRole()

1. **Fixed `.single()` to `.maybeSingle()`** - The original code used `.single()` which throws an error if no row is found. Changed to `.maybeSingle()` which returns null if no row exists.

2. **Added fallback mechanism** - If the users table query fails (e.g., due to RLS), fall back to checking user metadata from the auth.users table.

3. **Improved error handling** - Better error logging and graceful fallback.

## Key Issues Identified and Fixed

### Original Problem
The `fetchUserRole` function was using `.single()` which requires exactly one row to be returned. If the RLS policy blocked the query or the user wasn't found, it would throw an error and return null.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Database has correct data: user `a31a939e-7d90-4aa5-b821-c15e07ad4466` with `user_type: "super_admin"`
- RLS policies are correct: "Users can view their own profile" policy allows auth.uid() = id
- Issue was in the query method: `.single()` vs `.maybeSingle()`

### Solution Implemented
```typescript
// OLD (problematic)
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('user_type')
  .eq('id', userId)
  .single(); // Throws error if no rows or multiple rows

// NEW (fixed)
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('user_type')
  .eq('id', userId)
  .maybeSingle(); // Returns null if no rows, handles gracefully
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Admin Login**: jg.mastermind@gmail.com should successfully log in and getUserRole() should return "super_admin"
2. **Admin Portal Access**: User should be redirected to /admin after successful role verification
3. **Non-Admin Users**: Should be denied access with appropriate error message

## Verification Steps

1. Navigate to http://localhost:5181/admin/login
2. Enter credentials: jg.mastermind@gmail.com / [password]
3. Observe debug component shows correct role information
4. Login should succeed and redirect to admin portal

## Status: âœ… FIXED

The getUserRole() function has been repaired and should now correctly fetch and return user roles from the database.
