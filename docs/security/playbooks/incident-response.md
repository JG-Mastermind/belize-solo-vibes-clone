## üîç Triage & Evidence Collection

### Initial Assessment (First 15 Minutes)

#### Incident Classification Checklist
- [ ] **Attack Vector Identified**: How did the incident occur?
- [ ] **Affected Systems**: Which components are compromised?
- [ ] **Data at Risk**: What sensitive data could be exposed?
- [ ] **Business Impact**: Customer-facing services affected?
- [ ] **Ongoing Threat**: Is the attack still active?

#### Evidence Collection Commands
```bash
# Security events from last hour
node scripts/security-watch.mjs --last=1h --export=incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).json

# System logs
docker logs belize-app --since="1h" > incident-app-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).log

# Database connection logs  
supabase logs --type=api --since="1h" > incident-db-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).log

# Access logs from CDN/load balancer
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CDN_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/logs/received?start=$(date -d '1 hour ago' -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  > incident-access-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).json
```

### Digital Forensics

#### Preserve Evidence
```bash
# Create incident evidence directory
mkdir incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
cd incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)

# Capture system state
npm run security:snapshot > system-state.json
git log --oneline -20 > recent-commits.log
ps aux > running-processes.log
netstat -an > network-connections.log
```

#### Database Audit Trail
```sql
-- Recent admin actions (last 24 hours)
SELECT * FROM admin_invitation_audit 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Security events analysis
SELECT event_type, COUNT(*), MIN(created_at), MAX(created_at)
FROM public.security_events 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY event_type
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Suspicious authentication patterns
SELECT ip_hash, COUNT(*), array_agg(DISTINCT event_type)
FROM public.security_events 
WHERE event_type IN ('auth_anomaly', 'rate_limit_exceeded')
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
GROUP BY ip_hash
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

    "description": "Security incident block - INC-'$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)'"
  }'

# Enable emergency rate limiting
export RATE_LIMIT_EMERGENCY_MODE=true
export RATE_LIMIT_UNAUTH_RPM=10
export RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_RPM=30
```

# Enable maintenance mode if necessary
echo "MAINTENANCE_MODE=true" >> .env.production
pm2 restart all

# Disable compromised features temporarily
export DISABLE_ADMIN_REGISTRATION=true
export DISABLE_PAYMENT_PROCESSING=true  # EXTREME ONLY
