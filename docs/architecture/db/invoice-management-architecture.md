- **InvoicesReceived** (`/dashboard/invoices/received`)  
  - Vendor invoice management and approval workflows
  - Expense categorization and tracking
  - Multi-stage approval process with rejection handling
  - Payment scheduling and vendor payment tracking

- **FinancialReports** (`/dashboard/invoices/reports`)
