🚨 SESSION INITIALIZATION REQUIRED - READ FIRST
**MANDATORY**: Initiate session by reading local context files as specified in bootstrap sequence

⚡ **SESSION BOOTSTRAP COMMAND**:
```bash
# 1) Load local session context (NEVER commit .claude/)
read .claude/context.md
read .claude/session-template.md  
read .claude/session.md
read .claude/settings.local.json

# 2) ALWAYS review CHANGELOG.md for recent project changes
read CHANGELOG.md

# 3) Load optional Master Dev Manual if present
if [ -f docs/Claude-Ready Master Dev Manual.md ]; then
  read docs/Claude-Ready Master Dev Manual.md
fi

# 4) Auto-discover and load sub-agents (9 specialized agents available)
for f in .claude/agents/*.md .claude/agents/*.agent.md; do
  [ -f "$f" ] && read "$f"  
done

# 5) Prepare subagent readiness - identify task scope before work
# Match task to agent routing cheatsheet before proceeding
```

🚨 PRODUCTION PROJECT STATUS - READ FIRST
PROJECT MATURITY: 97% COMPLETE - DEPLOYMENT READY ✅
This is NOT a new project, demo, or experimental codebase.

Status: Production-ready application - DEPLOYMENT UNBLOCKED

Completion: 97% complete with deployment infrastructure stabilized

Codebase: Mature, interconnected system with established patterns

Users: Real users and business logic in production database

BUILD SYSTEM: ✅ OPERATIONAL - Deployment blockers resolved (Aug 22, 2025)

CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES
1. SURGICAL CHANGES ONLY
NO rewriting existing logic for simple fixes

NO new architectural patterns - use existing patterns

NO major refactoring - work within current structure

Find the simplest solution that fits the codebase

2. HIGH-RISK AREAS - EXTREME CAUTION
Database (migrations/RLS/SECURITY DEFINER)

Translation/i18n (multilingual routing)

Authentication (role-based access)

Booking & Payments (Stripe)

Routing (English/French URL patterns)

3. TREAT AS PRODUCTION
Every file matters — no experiments

Everything is interconnected — changes ripple

Real business impact — bugs affect real users

Launch timeline — delays cost money

4. PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACH
Understand first (read the code + patterns)

Minimal change (smallest viable fix)

Reuse existing infra (don’t reinvent)

Test carefully (unit/integration/E2E)

Ask before major changes (get explicit permission)

WHEN TO STOP AND ASK
Any database schema modifications

Changes to authentication or user roles

Modifications to payment or booking flow

Translation system changes

New dependencies / architectural patterns

Anything that smells like a rewrite

🔁 Session Bootstrap (/init)
Run this sequence at the start of every Claude Code session:

bash
Copy
Edit
# 1) Load local session context (NEVER commit .claude/)
read .claude/context.md
read .claude/session-template.md
read .claude/session.md
read .claude/settings.local.json

# 2) ALWAYS review CHANGELOG.md for recent project changes and context
read CHANGELOG.md

# 3) Load optional Master Dev Manual (single source of truth if present)
if [ -f docs/Claude-Ready Master Dev Manual.md ]; then
  read docs/Claude-Ready Master Dev Manual.md
fi

# 4) Auto-discover and load sub-agents (preferred over fallback)
for f in .claude/agents/*.md .claude/agents/*.agent.md; do
  [ -f "$f" ] && read "$f"
done

# 5) Prepare subagent readiness - identify task scope and select appropriate agent
# Match task to agent routing cheatsheet before proceeding with any work

# 6) Respect the IMMUTABLE block in this CLAUDE.md (do not modify it)
Rules:

.claude/ stays local only (not committed).

If an agent exists in .claude/agents/, prefer that definition over the fallback registry.

If not found, use the fallback registry below.

🧩 Agent Loader & Task Selection
Claude must choose exactly one sub‑agent per task. If a task spans multiple concerns, split into multiple PRs with one agent each.

Routing cheatsheet (9 Specialized Agents Available):

Password reset / Supabase recovery → Password Reset Surgeon

Migrations/RLS/SECURITY DEFINER → Backend Architecture Agent

/fr-ca routes, slug_fr, hreflang/sitemap → i18n Route & SEO Agent

Pipelines/tests/security scans → CI/CD Butler

Secrets/CSP/headers/rate limits/role enforcement checks → Security & Compliance Agent

Complex multi-step tasks / research / general development → General Purpose Agent

Code status line configuration → StatusLine Setup Agent

Claude Code output styling → Output Style Setup Agent

Business intelligence / analytics / booking reports → BelizeVibes Analytics Reporter

If an agent file is present in .claude/agents/ with the same name, use that file's scope; otherwise, fall back to the immutable registry below.

<!-- =========================== BEGIN IMMUTABLE REGISTRY DO NOT EDIT / DO NOT REMOVE This block must persist across /init updates. =========================== -->
🔐 IMMUTABLE: Core Agent Registry (Fallback)
Each agent is defined with Allowed Paths, DB Scope, Blocked Areas, and Testing Hooks. Do not exceed scope.

1) General Purpose Agent
Scope: Complex multi-step tasks, research, code searching, general development work requiring multiple tools/approaches.
Use for: Open-ended tasks, codebase exploration, feature planning, complex debugging, architectural analysis.
Tools: All tools available (*) - no restrictions on tool usage.

2) StatusLine Setup Agent  
Scope: Configure Claude Code status line settings for user workspace.
Use for: Status line configuration, user preferences, display customization.
Tools: Read, Edit only.

3) Output Style Setup Agent
Scope: Create and configure Claude Code output styles for enhanced user experience.
Use for: Output formatting, display preferences, styling configuration.
Tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, LS, Grep.

4) BelizeVibes Analytics Reporter
Scope: Business intelligence, analytics, booking data analysis, revenue insights for tourism platform.
Use for: Business reports, booking trends, revenue analysis, customer insights, data exports.
Tools: All tools available (*) - full analytics capabilities.

5) Password Reset Surgeon (Authentication Flow)
Scope: Fix/guard Supabase password recovery so reset links never auto‑login; require explicit password entry; sign out after reset.

Allowed (read/write):

src/components/auth/**

src/pages/auth/callback.tsx

src/pages/ResetPassword.tsx or src/pages/NewPassword.tsx (create if missing)

src/components/auth/__tests__/**, src/__tests__/auth/**

docs/runbooks/password-reset.md

DB Scope:

No DDL. May require Supabase Auth redirect URL changes (dashboard) to land on the reset form.

Blocked:

Booking/Stripe flows, admin portal, dashboards, blog internals, i18n/SEO code, migrations.

Testing Hooks (must pass):

Existing auth tests remain green (e.g., RequireRole.test.tsx).

New tests: recovery URL → no session adoption → reset form → updateUser({ password }) → signOut() → manual login required.

(If present) E2E: happy path + expired token.

Acceptance: No code path sets a session during recovery; minimal diff; all tests pass.

6) Backend Architecture Agent
Scope: Database schema stability, Supabase migrations, RLS policy integrity.

Allowed (read/write):

supabase/migrations/**

supabase/functions/** (DB contract enforcement only)

supabase/.temp/** (scratch)

scripts/db/** (helper scripts)

docs/architecture/db/** (ERDs, rollback playbooks)

DB Scope:

Tables: tours (canonical), users, bookings, testimonials, admin_invitations, admin_invitation_audit

Functions: accept_admin_invitation(...) (SECURITY DEFINER) + SQL utilities

Policies: RLS on tables above

Migrations: up/down idempotency; conflict resolution

Blocked:

/src/pages/**, /src/components/** (UI)

Stripe/webhooks business logic

Secrets in code

Testing Hooks:

Drift check (supabase db diff) clean

Up → Down → Up passes on blank DB and snapshot schema

RLS tests: allow/deny per role proven

Canonical assertion: no writes to deprecated adventures; reads/writes use tours

Acceptance: Green migration cycle, proven RLS, secure SECURITY DEFINER, canonical tours enforced.

7) i18n Route & SEO Agent
Scope: /fr-ca/* routing, slug_fr support, hreflang + sitemap; English routes must remain unchanged.

Allowed (read/write):

src/App.tsx

src/pages/AdventureDetail.tsx, src/pages/Safety.tsx, src/pages/About.tsx, src/pages/Contact.tsx (route wiring only)

src/hooks/useLanguageContext.ts (new)

src/utils/languageDetection.ts (new)

src/utils/frenchSlugs.ts (new)

src/components/SEO/GlobalMeta.tsx (hreflang)

src/utils/sitemapGenerator.ts

src/__tests__/i18n/**

DB Scope:

Migration to add tours.slug_fr (nullable) + backfill (approved)

Read‑only slug ↔ slug_fr mapping

Blocked:

Booking, payments, admin portal, auth flows, blog internals

Testing Hooks:

Unit: language detection + slug utils

Integration: / renders EN; /fr-ca/* renders FR; valid hreflang pairs

Non‑functional: Lighthouse on /fr-ca/* meets perf budget; EN snapshots unchanged

Acceptance: /fr-ca works with SEO slugs; English routes identical; tests pass.

8) CI/CD Butler
Scope: Pipelines for lint/type/test/build; optional E2E; security scans.

Allowed (read/write):

.github/workflows/ci.yml

.github/workflows/e2e.yml (optional)

.github/workflows/security.yml (optional)

package.json (scripts only)

docs/runbooks/ci.md

cypress/** or e2e/** scaffolds (optional)

DB Scope:

None. May spin up a temp DB; no schema edits.

Blocked:

Feature source files, edge functions, secrets

Testing Hooks (PR gates):

npm run lint, npm run type-check, npm test -- --coverage, npm run build

Optional labeled E2E job

Security job (npm audit, secret scan) report → later gate

Acceptance: CI blocks on failures; no secret leakage; cached fast path.

9) Security & Compliance Agent
Scope: Secrets hygiene, baseline headers/CSP, rate‑limiting guards, role enforcement checks.

Allowed (read/write):

.github/workflows/security.yml (+ security steps in ci.yml)

vite.config.ts (dev preview headers only)

docs/runbooks/security.md

scripts/security/** (scan patterns, CSP checks)

supabase/functions/** (rate limit/auth guard middleware only)

DB/Config Scope:

No DDL; adjust Edge Function CORS/auth guards as needed

Verify .env.example exists; no secrets in repo

Blocked:

UI/business code, Stripe/webhooks logic, printing secrets

Testing Hooks:

Secret scan (repo + PR diff) → zero findings

Dev preview sends security headers (X‑Frame‑Options, X‑Content‑Type‑Options, Referrer‑Policy; CSP documented)

npm audit --audit-level=high runs (report → later gate)

Auth reset E2E (from Password Reset Surgeon) wired into security job

Acceptance: Security workflow active; headers present; no leaks; auth hardening tests pass.

<!-- =========================== END IMMUTABLE REGISTRY =========================== -->
🧭 Execution Contract (All Agents)
One agent per PR (split cross‑cutting work).

Diff discipline: small, scoped, within Allowed Paths.

No silent rewrites or opportunistic refactors.

Tests required: run relevant unit/integration/E2E for the chosen agent.

Docs: update/create runbooks in /docs/runbooks/ for new flows/pipelines.

Approvals: any schema or auth/role change needs explicit CTO approval.

Development Commands
Start dev server: npm run dev (port 5173)

Start backend server: npm run dev:server

Build prod: npm run build • Preview: npm run preview

Lint: npm run lint • Types: npm run type-check • Tests: npm test

Architecture Overview (Short)
Frontend: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript • Tailwind + shadcn/ui • React Router v6
State: React Context + TanStack Query
Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
Payments: Stripe
i18n: i18next (English + fr‑CA) • URL‑based detection for /fr-ca/*
Routing: Nested layouts, bilingual routes

Important Patterns & Lessons (Kept for Context)
Language/i18n System: URL-based detection (/ EN, /fr-ca/* FR); slug_fr for SEO; hreflang + sitemap.

Booking System: Multi-step flow, availability, Stripe; keep untouched unless scoped.

Authentication Flow: Supabase Auth; role-based access; no client-side role elevation.

DB Lessons: Audit first; exact IDs/values; single-record test then batch; no comments in SQL; never rush.

Meta Title Fix Pattern: Missing namespace → add both EN/FR; validate with build.

🚨 CRITICAL: 5-Day Admin Portal Authentication Crisis - Post-Mortem Report

**INCIDENT SUMMARY:**
Admin portal was completely non-functional. Super admin user `jg.mastermind@gmail.com` could not log in despite having correct credentials and database records. Frontend showed "Invalid login credentials" error while backend Supabase Auth API returned 400 Bad Request.

**ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED:**

1. **Multiple Supabase Client Instances (Primary Cause)**
   - File: `src/lib/supabase.ts` created duplicate GoTrueClient instance
   - Conflicted with main client in `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
   - Console warning: "Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected in the same browser context"
   - Result: Auth requests failed due to client state conflicts

2. **Database Trigger Failure (Secondary)**
   - Function: `handle_new_user()` missing `user_type` field in INSERT
   - Triggered on auth.users INSERT, failed on public.users constraint
   - Result: User creation partially failed, inconsistent data state

3. **Query Method Error in Role Detection**
   - Code: `fetchUserRole()` used `.single()` instead of `.maybeSingle()`
   - Result: Threw errors when no user found, broke role detection flow

4. **Data Consistency Issues**
   - User records existed in auth.users but not properly synced to public.users
   - Missing or incorrect user_type, is_verified flags
   - Result: Authentication succeeded but role verification failed

**IMPACT:**
- Admin portal completely inaccessible for 5 days
- Super admin, admin, and tour guide roles non-functional
- Blocked all administrative functions, user management, content management

**PERMANENT FIXES APPLIED:**
1. **Removed Duplicate Client**: Deleted conflicting `src/lib/supabase.ts`
2. **Fixed Database Trigger**: Updated `handle_new_user()` to include user_type with fallback
3. **Fixed Role Query**: Changed `.single()` to `.maybeSingle()` in getUserRole()
4. **User Data Cleanup**: Rebuilt admin user with proper metadata in both auth.users and public.users

**CRITICAL LESSONS FOR DEV TEAM:**
- ⚠️ **NEVER create additional Supabase clients** - always use single instance from `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- ⚠️ **Database triggers MUST handle ALL required fields** - missing fields cause cascade failures
- ⚠️ **Test authentication at API level FIRST** before debugging frontend
- ⚠️ **Role-based systems require data consistency** across auth.users and public.users tables
- ⚠️ **Console warnings about multiple clients are CRITICAL** - indicates breaking auth conflicts

**PREVENTION CHECKLIST FOR FUTURE AUTH WORK:**
- Always verify single Supabase client instance
- Test Edge Function authentication before frontend debugging
- Check database triggers handle all required fields
- Verify user exists in BOTH auth.users AND public.users with matching data
- Monitor console for GoTrueClient warnings

🔧 Technical Fixes Applied (Aug 2025)
1. **getUserRole() Function**: Fixed .single() → .maybeSingle() to handle null results gracefully
2. **Database Trigger**: Updated handle_new_user() to include user_type field with proper fallback
3. **Duplicate Supabase Clients**: Removed conflicting src/lib/supabase.ts that caused multiple GoTrueClient instances
4. **Admin User Setup**: Use Edge Functions for secure user creation with proper role metadata

⚡ Performance Optimizations Applied (Aug 15, 2025)
1. **Image Lazy Loading**: Implemented `loading="lazy"` across all image components
   - AdventureCards.tsx, Testimonials.tsx, BlogPost.tsx, ImageGallery.tsx
   - Impact: 50% reduction in initial image payload, +30% LCP improvement
2. **React.memo Optimization**: Memoized expensive UI components for render performance
   - AdventureCards individual cards, DashboardCharts (Revenue/Booking)
   - Impact: ~70% reduction in unnecessary re-renders, improved responsiveness
   - Zero breaking changes, all functionality preserved

🔑 API Management System Implemented (Aug 18, 2025)
1. **Super Admin API Management**: Complete enterprise-grade monitoring system
   - **Routes**: 6 functional routes under `/dashboard/api-management/*` - ALL ROUTING SOLID ✅
   - **Security**: RequireRole super_admin protection on all routes and components
   - **Backend**: 8 database tables + 3 edge functions (architecture ready for real data)
2. **Data Status**: Mock data for development - structures match production schema exactly
   - **Integration Ready**: Replace mock data with real API calls when connecting live services
   - **Routing Guarantee**: All sidebar links work without 404 errors - production routing stable

🚀 DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS RESOLVED (Aug 22, 2025)
**CRITICAL SUCCESS**: 6-hour deployment crisis resolved in 20 minutes using CI/CD Butler agent
1. **Primary Fix**: Supabase mock TypeScript violations eliminated
   - `src/__mocks__/supabase-client.ts` - Implemented proper `PostgrestResponse<T>` types
   - 13 critical `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` errors resolved
   - Added comprehensive `MockQueryBuilder` interface for type safety
2. **ESLint Compliance**: 188 violations → 35 warnings (83% improvement, 0 errors)
3. **Test Stabilization**: AuthCallback security tests now passing (5/5)
4. **Build System**: ✅ TypeScript check, ✅ Build success (791KB), ✅ Deploy ready
**STATUS**: 🚀 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT UNBLOCKED - All systems operational

Claude Code Session Initialization (Local)
Always read the local .claude/ directory at session start (not committed):

bash
Copy
Edit
read .claude/context.md
read .claude/session-template.md
read .claude/session.md
read .claude/settings.local.json
These hold: project context, autonomous dev role, boundaries, and required tests. They override default Claude behavior.
