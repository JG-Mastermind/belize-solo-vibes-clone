## Database Lessons Learned

### Critical SQL Command Mistakes
- Rushed SQL commands without careful verification
- Included comments in SQL causing syntax errors
- Assumed titles instead of using exact database values
- Kept trying different approaches instead of being surgical

### Correct Approach to Database Work
- Audit first, change second
- Use exact IDs and values from database results
- Test on single record, then batch
- NO comments in SQL queries
- Stop and verify each step instead of rushing

### Guiding Principle
Database = Production Business Logic. Not a testing playground.

### Commitment to Improvement
- Be precise with exact values
- Verify each step completely
- Use surgical approaches only
- Never rush SQL commands
